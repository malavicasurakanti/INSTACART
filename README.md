# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Instacart's sales patterns to enhance customer segmentation and targeting strategies. As an analyst at Instacart, an online grocery store, I'll perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights that will inform targeted marketing campaigns. The analysis will focus on various customer profiles and their purchasing behaviors, aiming to optimize ad placements and product recommendations.

## Objective
